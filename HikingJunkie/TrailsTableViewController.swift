Respect all no parking signs on the surrounding surface streets, or you may get a ticket. No parking or admission fees. No designated handicapped parking, and preserve trails are not wheelchair accessible. Vault toilet at the edge of the parking lot. No water. Maps available at the information signboard.

The featured hike's high point is about 1170 feet, but one trail wanders up and down considerably, and the hike's total ascent is about 1110 feet. You can take this hike in either direction, but Coyote Ridge Trail is a steep fire road, in my opinion, better hiked down than up.\n Season: Nice any time.\n Exposure: Mix of sun and shade.\n Trail traffic: Moderate.\n $6 entrance/parking fee. Parking for 17 vehicles, and one designated handicapped parking spot. Restrooms and drinking water at picnic area. If you look at the map(s) on line before visiting these parks, note that although the maps show parking areas at the Madrone and Sycamore Group Areas, the gates leading to the areas are not always open. There is some roadside parking at this southern portion of the park, but your best bet is to use the main entrance to Stevens Creek County Park as a trailhead. There is no direct public transportation to the park. Trails are wheelchair accessible for short distances."

No dogs are permitted in the west lot (this is the one accessed by Almaden Expressway), so if you want to bring a dog, use the east entrance trailhead: from CA 85 drive on Almaden Expressway, turn left onto Coleman, right on Winfield, then turn right into the park. $6 parking fees are charged during summer months, but access is free other times of the year. You'll find restrooms, drinking water, and a pay phone at the trailhead. There are no maps of Los Alamitos Creek Trail at the trailhead, but interpretive signs along the trail highlight the route. There are several designated handicapped parking spaces, and trails are well suited to wheelchairs and strollers. This trail is accessible by public transportation. Visit the Transit Info website for details. You can also access this trail via a 25 car trailhead (no fee) on Camden Avenue at Mt. Forest Drive."
