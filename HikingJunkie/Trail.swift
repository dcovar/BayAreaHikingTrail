Trailhead elevation is around 350 feet. The hike is flat for about 1 mile, climbs on a moderate grade to about 1045 feet, descends to about 330 feet, and returns to the trailhead on a level grade. This is a good hike for beginners starting to stretch their legs a bit; experienced hikers will probably find it easy. There are opportunities at Rancho for longer, harder hikes", iSeason: "Season: Nice any time.", iRule: "Rules:\nMost trails are designated hiking and equestrian only. A few are open to hikers and cyclists only. There are a handful of hiking only trails. Dogs are not permitted.", iDetail: "Hiking Trail Details:\nOnce in the park, bear right and drive to the last parking lot, at the end of the park road. Lots of parking, but the lots fill up quickly at this popular park. No entrance or parking fees. Maps available at a kiosk inside the park.

Trailhead elevation is about 400 feet. The park's high point is about 2517 feet; total elevation change for this hike is about 2200 feet. A Bay Area Hiker reader who preferred to remain anonymous describes the route perfectly: this trail is not for beginners or casual 'neighborhood' walkers. It is somewhat steep and continually demanding.", iSeason: "Season: Muddy in winter, hot in summer, best in spring.", iRule: "Rules:\nMost trails are multi-use. A few are open to hikers and horses only (and of course, cows). Dogs are permitted. Park is open from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m., unless otherwise posted.", iDetail: "Hiking Trail Details:\nLots of parking in a lot at the edge of a residential neighborhood. Respect all no parking signs on the surrounding surface streets, or you may get a ticket. No parking or admission fees. No designated handicapped parking, and preserve trails are not wheelchair accessible. Vault toilet at the edge of the parking lot. No water. Maps available at the information signboard.

If you look at the map(s) on line before visiting these parks, note that although the maps show parking areas at the Madrone and Sycamore Group Areas, the gates leading to the areas are not always open. There is some roadside parking at this southern portion of the park, but your best bet is to use the main entrance to Stevens Creek County Park as a trailhead.

No dogs are permitted in the west lot (this is the one accessed by Almaden Expressway), so if you want to bring a dog, use the east entrance trailhead: from CA 85 drive on Almaden Expressway, turn left onto Coleman, right on Winfield, then turn right into the park. $6 parking fees are charged during summer months, but access is free other times of the year. You'll find restrooms, drinking water, and a pay phone at the trailhead. There are no maps of Los Alamitos Creek Trail at the trailhead, but interpretive signs along the trail highlight the route. There are several designated handicapped parking spaces, and trails are well suited to wheelchairs and strollers. This trail is accessible by public transportation.
